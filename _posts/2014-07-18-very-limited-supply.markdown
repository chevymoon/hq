description: There will only be 300,000 collectibles for collection and there will never be an owner or CEO or some company that hoards the supply to enrich themselves. This collectible is community driven and will enrich no one but the community itself, depending on how the community behaves and promotes their collectibles. The reasoning for such a limited supply is prevent unaccounted amounts floating around and to make it relatively easy to track who has what without exposing identities. There is no company to dump this collectible at any point and there are no tracking mechanisms outside of the contract itself. Futhermore, there are five decimal points behind to allow for the perfect precision for the burn rate. Due to the extremely limited supply, being that no more will ever be minted, these collectibles are sure to retain their value for a long time.

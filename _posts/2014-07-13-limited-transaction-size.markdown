description: Transactions are limited to a number of 10 collectibles. Trying to send more than 10 in any transaction will result in failure. No more than 10 collectibles can be swapped at once. Due to the already high burn-rate, this will prevent whales from accumulating too much Whale Phal. Even if a whale used many different accounts to accumulate Whale Phal on one wallet, they would have to pay an excessive burn rate to move those collectibles within a reasonable time frame to influence prices, from said wallet. There also is a limit on sending any transaction with any wallet with more than 10% of the total supply. This is to prevent one exchange from accumulating too much Whale Phal to prevent price swings, particularly those for overselling. This should lead to interesting arbitrage opportunities as well.

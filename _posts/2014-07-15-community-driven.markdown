description: Whale Phal is not owned by any single entity including the creator and team behind Whale Phal. Besides the swap contract having the collectibles until they sell out, there cannot be any whales in the network as it would cost too much to accumulate due to the burn rate. This should ensure a fair level of play for even the smallest level of participants. As such; since there is no leader, no CEO, or company backing the collectible, it cannot be classified as a staking tool, form of debt or equity. There will never be any copyright or trademark attempt ever made. Since all people are encouraged to participate equally and fairly, this would technically result in a quasi-democracy, where everyone benefits mostly equally from any benefit to the collectible; listing on exchanges, legal recognition and the such.

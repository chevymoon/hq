category: Sandclock burn rate - (+260k) 14.2%, (+220k) 10%, (+200k) 0% -- Standard Burn Rate 25%, 20%, 12.5%, 10%, 0%
description: There are two separate burn rates; the sandclock and the standard burn rate. The sandclock depends on time and the total supply of collectibles. If the community manages to keep the total supply above 260,000 collectibles in 365 days, then the burn rate will drop to 14.2% instead of the standard 20% in one year. If the community hit the first target, then if after another 365 days it manages to keep the supply above 220,000 collectibles, the burn rate will be 10% instead of the 14.2% of the standard. After three years, if both targets were achieved and the supply remains above 200,000 collectibles, the burn rate will officially remain 0%, a whole three years earlier than the standard burn rate.

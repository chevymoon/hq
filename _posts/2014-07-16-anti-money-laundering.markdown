category: Prior to regulatory agencies educating themselves, Whale Phal may be mislabled a token. Proceed with caution if you are eligble to participate. 
description: With regulations increasing by the day and regulatory agencies increasingly troubled by money laundering done through crypto, Whale Phal is the first unique digital tool of it's kind, it can't be used for money laundering. Due to the insanely high burn rate of 25% starting out, the wallet cap of 10% max supply for exchanges and the cap on a maximum transition of 10 collectibles, no criminal or money laundering attempt will be made through with these collectibles. To add, due to the culture behind the collectible; one of HODLing and democratic decision making, it will hopefully lead to regulatory agencies having a soft spot for this collectible. The combination of tight coupling on the contract level with fair distribution will keep negative elements out.

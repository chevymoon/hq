description: Every 180 days, there is one burn-free trade allowed be ethereum address. This will allow those who wish to transfer to cold storage to do so. The burn rate will decrease every year, correspondingly; 25%, 20%, 14.2%, 12.5%, 10% and 0%. Each successive year, the burn rate will decrease automatically, so the supply should continue to decrease over time thus rendering the collectibles some value over time. After six years, the collectible will be free to trade and by then, the supply will be limited enough to ensure that there are few enough to have the perception of value be accordingly high. There also is burn rate when buying from the swap.

                                <br /><br />
                                <p>Nika is a token for contract development and custom interactions
                                    with the Nika blockchain. Amongst many things we plan on implementing
                                    staking, oracles, legal documentation stored on the ethereum chain and
                                    personal IDs for custom databases. We'll also use our own brand of Nika
                                    tokens to create an off-chain mobile cryptocurrency network. Our tokens
                                    will be distributed in a huge airdrop and implement deflationary tokenomics
                                    as well as burn-free transactions. We estimate it will take five years for launch
                                    as such, there are implemented burn-rates built in for five years.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    By sending Nika to various contracts we own, you'll be able to get various
                                    information, do lending, upload legal documents, receive approval, get
                                    a new Nika credit rating and do many other things in a decentralized fashion.
                                    We are currently building our data storage contract which will allow users
                                    to have a tiny database at the cost of some gas and one Nika. Contract development
                                    will occur over the next six months and will be entirely decentralized. We'll use
                                    the funds of selling Nika tokens on exchanges to fund development.

                                    <br /><br />
                                    We aim on using huge numbers, large funds and superior leadership 
                                    to protect the interests of the cryptocurrency sphere. This project
                                    aims to become the biggest airdrop token of all time. Afterwards, we
                                    will work on securing venture capital funding, political legitimacy and
                                    work towards the concerns our userbase has. We will use our airdrop
                                    to distribute fairly 5 billion tokens while keeping an additional 5 billion (50%) for dev funding.
                                    We have implemented transaction caps to prevent whales hoarding too much
                                    too quickly. 
                                    
                                    <br /><br />We have also implemented a burn rate and a cap 
                                    against any exchange owning more than 10% of the supply, to prevent downtrends.
                                    The burn rate goes down to 0%
                                    after the course of 5 years to encourage HODLing until we have reached
                                    altitude. We don't have a whitepaper or professional site, we'll focus on only
                                    what we need at the moment.
                                    We don't necessarily aim to focus on one area, but instead use
                                    our massive economies of scale to succeed. In short, we aim to be the
                                    Amazon of the cryptocurrency sphere.
